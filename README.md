# RecyclerViewActivity
Recycler View Activity, submitted by: Dizon | Lacson | Sanchez | Tuazon

# Notes
- We modified the design of application to achieve a better flow.
- We fixed the height of the short description in the MainActivity (TecyclerView layout) so that the user will have to press the "Read" button, which will open the dialog.
- The emulator phone used during the simulation is Pixel 3a.
- We implemented lottie dependecies for the animation of the loading animation.
