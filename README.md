# RecyclerViewActivity
Recycler View Activity, submitted by: Dizon | Lacson | Sanchez | Tuazon

# Notes
- We modified the design of the application to achieve a better flow.
- We fixed the height of the short description in the MainActivity (TecyclerView layout) so that the user will have to press the "Read" button, which will open the dialog. The dialog contains the complete short description of the book.
- The 'Shop Now' button will open the other activity, which contains the synopsis, the full description, and the button that will open the browser.
- The emulator phone used during the simulation is Pixel 3a.
- We implemented lottie dependecies for the animation of the loading animation.
